Snake game in Python

This is a small practice project built in Python. To start the game, run the run.py file. Snake moves every second. User can control the direction of snake by using AWSD commands. When snake eats a candy, it grows longer. When snake hits itself or the wall, it dies and game is over lol.

Here's a short demo on Youtube: [Click me](https://youtu.be/Yg553lY-Wtc)

*This project has only been tested in Python 2.7.6
**This project does not work on Windows environment, as it uses select from sys module, which requires a socket, which is lacking in Windows OS ;(

I hope you will like it :)
